# Description
To covert nearly any number into a palindromic number you operate by reversing the digits and adding and then repeating the steps until you get a palindromic number. Some require many steps.

e.g. 24 gets palindromic after 1 steps: 66 -&gt; 24 + 42 = 66

while 28 gets palindromic after 2 steps: 121 -&gt; 28 + 82 = 110, so 110 + 11 (110 reversed) = 121.

Note that, as an example, 196 never gets palindromic (at least according to researchers, at least never in reasonable time). Several numbers never appear to approach being palindromic.

# Input Description

You will be given a number, one per line. Example:

    11
    68

# Output Description

You will describe how many steps it took to get it to be palindromic, and what the resulting palindrome is. Example:

    11 gets palindromic after 0 steps: 11
    68 gets palindromic after 3 steps: 1111

# Challenge Input

    123
    286
    196196871

# Challenge Input Solution 

    123 gets palindromic after 1 steps: 444
    286 gets palindromic after 23 steps: 8813200023188
    196196871 gets palindromic after 45 steps: 4478555400006996000045558744

# Note

Bonus: see which input numbers, through 1000, yield identical palindromes. 

Bonus 2: See which numbers don't get palindromic in under 10000 steps. Numbers that never converge are called Lychrel numbers. 

# Scala Solution

	def reverse(n:Long): Long = n.toString.reverse.toLong

	def palindrome(n:Long): Boolean =  n == reverse(n)

	def loop(n:Long, steps:Int): (Long, Int) = {
		palindrome(n) match {
			case true  => (n, steps)
			case false => loop(reverse(n)+n, steps + 1)
		}
	}
