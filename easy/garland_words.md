# Description

A garland word is a word which can be formed by chopping off the last few letters and "wrapping around" to the start.

For example: You can chop off the the trailing "on" from "onion" and still form the word by wrapping around to the starting "on". In other words, you can write the letters "o", "n", "i" in a circle, in that order, and form the word "onion".

A garland word is of degree n if you can do the above with the last n letters of the word.
