# Title

Basic Graph Statistics: Node Degrees

# Difficulty

Easy

# Description

In graph theory, the *degree* of a node is the number of edges coming into it or going out of it - how connected it is. For this challenge you'll be calculating the degree of every node. 

# Input Description

First you'll be given an integer, *N*, on one line showing you how many nodes to account for. Next you'll be given an undirected graph as a series of number pairs, *a* and *b*, showing that those two nodes are connected - an edge. Example:

    3 
    1 2
    1 3

# Output Description

Your program should emit the degree for each node. Example:

    Node 1 has a degree of 2
    Node 2 has a degree of 1
    Node 3 has a degree of 1

# Challenge Input

This data set is an social network of tribes of the Gahukuâ€“Gama alliance structure of the Eastern Central Highlands of New Guinea, from Kenneth Read (1954). The dataset contains a list of all of links, where a link represents signed friendships between tribes. It was downloaded from http://networkrepository.com/soc_tribes.php.

# Bonus: Adjascency Matrix

Another tool used in graph theory is an *adjacency matrix*, which is an *N* by *N* matrix where each *(i,j)* cell is filled out with the degree of connection between nodes *i* and *j*. For our example graph above the adjacency matrix would look like this:

    0 1 1
    1 0 0
    1 0 0

Indicating that node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, but nodes 2 and 3 do not connect. For a bonus, create the adjacency matrix for the challenge graph.
