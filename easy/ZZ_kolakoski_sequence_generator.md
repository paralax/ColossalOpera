# Description

In mathematics, the [Kolakoski sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolakoski_sequence) (named after William Kolakoski) is an infinite sequence of symbols {1,2} which is its own run-length encoding. The sequence begins

	1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2

The sequence may be generated by an algorithm that, in the *i*th iteration, reads the value x*i* that has already been output as the *i*th value of the sequence (or, if no such value has been output yet, sets x_i = i). Then, if i is odd, it outputs xi copies of the number 1, while if i is even, it outputs x_i copies of the number 2. 

The Kolakoski sequence is similar to the [Look and Say sequence](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ggy30/9152014_challenge180_easy_looknsay/) challenge we did before.

# Input Description

Instead of outputting the sequence to some value *n* today, you'll have to return how many ones and twos are in the sequence at that point. Input will be a single digit on a line, *n*, for the length of the sequence to generate. For example:

	108

# Output Description

Your program should emit how many ones and twos are in the sequence to that length. From our example:

	53 ones, 55 twos

# Challenge Input

	1000
	54321

# Challenge Output

	504 ones, 496 twos
	27141 ones, 27180 twos
