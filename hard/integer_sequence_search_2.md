# Description

This is part 2 of the Integer sequence search functionality. An integer sequence is a sequence (i.e., an ordered list) of integers. 

Not all sequences are computable (e.g. not all have a formula that can express them), but many do. 

For this challenge you'll be searching sequences expressed as a recurrence relation. We did recurrence relations as a [previous exercise #206E](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2z68di/20150316\_challenge\_206\_easy\_recurrence\_relations/).

# Input Description

You'll be given two integers, *N* and *M*, which tell you how many sequences to read to form your database and then how many search queries to process, respectively. Then you'll be given the database as *N* pairs of *name* and *recurrence relation* pair. Starting conditions will be given following the "with" keyword. Then you'll be given *M* queries of a series of integers. Some notes:

* All sequences to search will be contiguous (no gaps). 
* Not all sequences you will be searching for will start at the beginning. 
* The overlap of the query and the sequence database will be unambiguous but is not guaranteed to overlap completely. 
* Sequence names will use the OEIS naming convention.

Recurrence relations will be given as a relationship of numbers in the sequence and the starting conditions. 

Example:

	1 1
	A000045 F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2) with F(0)=0, F(1)=1
 	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 

# Output Description

Your program should emit the sequence and its OEIS identifier. Use the identifier "NOTFOUND" for those not in the database. Example:

	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 A000045

# Challenge Input

	5 6
	A000045 F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2) with F(0)=0, F(1)=1
	A000931	F(n) = F(n-2)+F(n-3) with F(0)=1, F(1)=0, F(2)=0
	A001608	F(n) = F(n-2)+F(n-3) with F(0)=3, F(1)=0, F(2)=2
	A000032	F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2)
	A001608	F(n) = F(n-2)+F(n-3) with F(0)=3, F(1)=0, F(2)=2
	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 	
	1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5 
	3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12 
	2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76 
	3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 17 	
	1, 1, 5, 5, 45, 95, 465, 1165 

# Challenge Output

	0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 A000045	
	1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5 A000931
	3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12 A001608
	2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47. 76 A000032
