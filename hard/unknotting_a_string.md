# Description

Given a string with points labeled `A` through `Z` in sequence, imagine it's now been knotted. This string is a real tangle and mess. Knots will be expressed as a sequence of pairs of points on the string that indicate the crossings. 

This is an [open P-Hard problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknotting_problem) - worth reading about. This was on my mind a couple of years ago when I was unknotting some fishing line. 

Your task today is to unknot the string using a program. 

# Input Description

You'll be given inputs as one string per line, indicating where the string knots form. These two pairs of points indicate where the string crosses. Example:

	KH LQ ZI XJ VT GN SE BU RP FD YM OW CA

# Output Description

Your program should emit the order of knots to untie to restore the string and not create new knots.
