Balancing chemical equations

# Difficulty

Hard

# Description

Rob was just learning to balance chemical equations from his teacher, but Rob was also a programmer, so he wanted to automate the process of doing it by hand. Well, it turns out that Rob isn't a great programmer, and so he's looking to you for help. Can you help him out?

Balancing chemical equations is pretty straight forward - it's all in conservation of mass. Remember this: A balanced equation MUST have EQUAL numbers of EACH type of atom on BOTH sides of the arrow. Here's a great tutorial on the subject: http://www.chemteam.info/Equations/Balance-Equation.html 

# Input

The input is a chemical equation without amounts. In order to make this possible in pure ASCII, we write any subscripts as ordinary numbers. Element names always start with a capital letter and may be followed by a lowercase letter (e.g. Co for cobalt, which is different than CO for carbon monoxide, a C carbon and an O oxygen). The molecules are separated with + signs, an ASCII-art arrow -> is inserted between both sides of the equation and represents the reaction:

    Al + Fe2O4 -> Fe + Al2O3

# Output

The output of your program is the input equation augmented with extra numbers. The number of atoms for each element must be the same on both sides of the arrow. For the example above, a valid output is:

    2Al + Fe2O3 -> 2Fe + Al2O3

If the number for a molecule is 1, drop it. A number must always be a positive integer. Your program must yield numbers such that their sum is minimal. For instance, the following is illegal:

     100Al + 50Fe2O3 -> 100Fe + 50Al2O3
     
If there is not any solution print:

    Nope!

for any equation like

     Pb -> Au

(FWIW that's transmutation, or alchemy, and is simply not possible - lead into gold.) 

Preferably, format it neatly with spaces for greater readability but if and only if it's not possible, format your equation like:

    Al+Fe2O4->Fe+Al2O3

# Challenge inputs

    C5H12 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O
    Zn + HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2
    Ca(OH)2 + H3PO4 -> Ca3(PO4)2 + H2O
    FeCl3 + NH4OH -> Fe(OH)3 + NH4Cl
    K4[Fe(SCN)6] + K2Cr2O7 + H2SO4 -> Fe2(SO4)3 + Cr2(SO4)3 + CO2 + H2O + K2SO4 + KNO3

# Challenge outputs 

    C5H12 + 8O2 -> 5CO2 + 6H2O
    Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2
    3Ca(OH)2 + 2H3PO4 -> Ca3(PO4)2 + 6H2O
    FeCl3 + 3NH4OH -> Fe(OH)3 + 3NH4Cl
    6K4[Fe(SCN)6] + 97K2Cr2O7 + 355H2SO4 -> 3Fe2(SO4)3 + 97Cr2(SO4)3 + 36CO2 + 355H2O + 91K2SO4 +  36KNO3
