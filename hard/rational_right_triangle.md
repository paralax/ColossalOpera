# Description

In mathematics, a rational number is defined as any number that can be expressed as a fraction. In number theory, one of the implications of Fermat's right triangle theorem is that a right triangle for which all three side lengths are rational numbers - a rational right triangle - cannot have an area that is the square of a rational number. 

So, using the Pythagorean theorem - the square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of each side - can you calculate the sides of a rational right triangle given the area? 

# Bonus

Can you find the _smallest_ such triangle as measured by perimeter (the sum of the lengths of the sides)?
