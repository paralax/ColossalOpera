Coiled sentence

# Difficulty 

Hard

# Description

You'll be given a matrix of letters that contain a coiled sentence. Your program should walk the grid to adjacent squares using only left, right, up, down (no diagonal) and every letter exactly once. You should wind up with a six word sentence made up of regular English words.

Your input will be a list of integers *N*, which tells you how many lines to read, then the row and column (indexed from 1) to start with, and then the letter matrix beginning on the next line.
