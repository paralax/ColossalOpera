# Description

In energy production, the power grid is a a large directed graph of energy consumers and producers. At times you need to cut at certain nodes and trim demand because you cannot supply enough of a load. 

In DailyProgrammeropolis, all buildings are connected to the grid and all consume power to varying degrees. Some generate power because they have installed on-site generation and sell the excess to the grid, some do not.

The scenario you're facing is this: due to a fault with the bulk power generation facility not local to DailyProgrammerololis, you must trim the power grid. You have connectivity data, and power consumption and production data. Your goal with this challenge is to **maximize the number of powered nodes with the generated energy you have**. Note that when you cut off a node, you run the risk the downstream ones will loose power, too, if they are no longer connected. This is how you'll shed demand, by selectively cutting the graph. You can make as many cuts as you want (there is no restriction on this). 

# Input Description

You'll be given an extensive set of data for this challenge. The first set of data looks like this: you'll be given a single integer on one line telling you how many nodes to read. Then you'll be given those nodes, one per line, with the node ID, the amount of power it consumes in kWH, then how much the node generates in kWH. Not all nodes produce electricity, but some do (e.g. a wind farm, solar cells, etc), and there is obviously one that generates the most - that's your main power plant.

The next set of data is the edge data. The first line is how many edges to read, then the next *N* lines have data showing how the nodes are connected (e.g. power flows from node a to b).
