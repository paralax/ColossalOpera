# Description

I've been a fan of text-based interactive fiction games for a long time, and used to play [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) a lot as a kid, as well as [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game\)). In college I got into MUDs, and several years ago I wrote a small MUD engine called [punymud](https://github.com/paralax/punymud) in an effort to see how much could be done in a small amount of code. 

Many games sometimes build on hand-generated worlds, but increasingly people explore *procedurally generated worlds*, or dungeons. This keeps games fresh and exciting. However, the development of such algorithms is crucial to keep it enticing to a human player and not repetitive. 

Today's challenge is open ended. Write code to procedurally generate dungeons. Some things to keep in mind:

- You can make it a 2D or 3D world, it's up to you.
- How you let people interact with it is up to you. You can make a series of maps (ASCII art, graphics, etc) or even output a world compatible with something like punymud. An example of a procedurally generated world that's just maps is the [Uncharted Atlas](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/) Twitter account, which uses code to create fake maps. The goal isn't to write a game engine, but rather something you could wrap a game engine around.
- Things like names, descriptions, items, etc - all optional. But really neat if you do. The Genmud code (below) has some examples of how to do that. 
- Your code must yield unique maps for every run. 

I encourage you to have fun, build on each other's work (and even work collaboratively if you wish), and see where this takes you. If you like this sort of thing, there's a [group of subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/) devoted to that type of thing.

I'll go over it in a little more detail than the steps in the original post. *I really like this writeup. While complicated, it's pretty clear and talks about the strategies to keep the game interesting.*

Note that this is not an article on how to code a random dungeon generator, but more a journal on how I went from zero ideas on how-to-do it to a fully working dungeon generator in the end.
