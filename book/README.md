# What

the Reddit dailyprogrammer challenge book, a pile of my own challenges (and some of my own solutions). mainly done to see if it could be semi-automated.

The vision is a book of challenges that describe key aspects of programming, like topics (algorithms, data structures, strategies, etc) and difficulty levels, well organized and illustrated with code examples. people learning to code, or improving their coding, compose the intended audience. Ideally we'd have multiple solutions per challenge showcasing various languages and paradigms, like OOP vs functional programming, logic programming and imperative programming and more. Preferably idiomatic, exemplar solutions.

# How

## The easy way

```
git clone https://github.com/paralax/ColossalOpera
cd ColossalOpera
sudo sh install.sh
```

## The hard way

* Pandoc for Markdown to LaTeX conversion - http://pandoc.org/installing.html
* LaTeX itself - https://tug.org/
* the LaTeX minted package - https://github.com/gpoore/minted
* which requires Pygments - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments
* the mdframed LaTeX package - https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdframed?lang=en
* white requires needspace - https://www.ctan.org/pkg/needspace?lang=en

install all dependencies with `tlmgr install`.

that seems to be it.
