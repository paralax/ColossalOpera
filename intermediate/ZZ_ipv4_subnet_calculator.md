# Description

In IPv4 networking, classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation is used to specific network addresses that fall outside of the historic "class A", "class B" and "class C" designation. Instead it's denoted in an IPv4 network address with a bit-lenegth mask. For example, the historic class A network of 10.0.0.0 is expressed as `10.0.0.0/8`, meaning only the first 8 bits of the network address are specified. CIDR notation allows you to specify networks outside of the classic octet boundaries. For those of you new to 32 bit binary values (expressed as dotted quads, as IPv4 addresses are), you may want to review [a guide to understanding IP address subnets and CIDR notation](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-ip-addresses-subnets-and-cidr-notation-for-networking). 

Again, note that CIDR notation needn't fall on octet boundaries (e.g. /8, /16, or /24). It's perfectly legal to have a /28 expressed as a CIDR so long as the bits line up appropriately. It will not be enough to see if the first two parts of the dotted quad are the same, this wouldn't work with a /17 for example.

For this challenge, you'll be given various IPv4 addresses and subnets and asked to remove ones already covered by a covering CIDR representation. This is a common operation in IP network management. 

# Input Description

You'll be given a single integer and then list of IPv4 host and addresses addresses, containing that many lines of input. Examples:

    3
    172.26.32.162/32
    172.26.32.0/24
    172.26.0.0/16

# Output Description

Your program should emit the minimal covering set of the network addresses to remove ones already specified by the network addresses. From the above example only `172.26.0.0/16` would remain.
