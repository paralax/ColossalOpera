[2015-03-26] Challenge #207 [Bonus] Erdos Number Calculator

# Difficulty

Intermediate

In honor of the 102nd birthday of the famous mathematician, a problem named after him. 

# Description

Paul Erdős (1913–1996) was an influential mathematician who spent a large portion of his later life writing papers with a large number of colleagues, working on solutions to outstanding mathematical problems. The idea of the Erdős number was originally created by the mathematician's friends as a tribute to his enormous output. However, in later years it gained prominence as a tool to study how mathematicians cooperate to find answers to unsolved problems. 

The Erdös number describes the "collaborative distance" between mathematician Paul Erdős and another person, as measured by authorship of mathematical papers. Erdös himself has a number of 0, anyone he co-authored a paper with has a number of 1, anyone they co-authored a paper with (without Erdös) has a number of 2, and so forth. 

Several studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erdős numbers. For example, only 134,007 mathematicians have an Erdős number, with a median value of 5. In contrast, the median Erdős number of Fields Medalists is 3. Only 7,097 (about 5%) of mathematicians with a collaboration path have an Erdős number of 2 or less.

For this challenge you'll be working with a small, toy database of Erdős and related publications and be asked to calculate the Erdős number for several authors. 

# Input Description

You'll be given 2 integers on the first line, *N* and *M*. *N* is the number of of papers in APA format showing authors, titles, journals, and the like; think of it as a mini database. *M* is the number of authors to identify the Erdős number for. Note that all of the names should be in the same format of last name, then first and middle initials. 

# Output 

Your program should emit the name of the mathematician and their Erdős number.

# Notes

This challenge is a shameless rip off of http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=downloadproblem&format=html&probid=110206. It was too good to pass up; I did, however, compile my own challenge inputs and outputs. 

A full list of Erdös publications is up here http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/Erdos.html.
