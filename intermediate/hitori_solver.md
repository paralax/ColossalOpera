# Description

Hitori is a logic puzzle similar to Soduku in that you aim to get unique digits in any column and row, but different in that you're given an *N*x*N* matrix and you have to knock out the flawed numbers. The rules (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitori)): "Hitori is played with a grid of squares or cells, and each cell contains a number. The objective is to eliminate numbers by filling in the squares such that remaining cells do not contain numbers that appear more than once in either a given row or column. Filled-in cells cannot be horizontally or vertically adjacent, although they can be diagonally adjacent. The remaining un-filled cells must form a single component connected horizontally and vertically." 

# Challenge Input

You'll be given an integer showing the number of rows and columns, then the board as a series of numbers, your program must output a board with the correct values removed (e.g. replaced with an X)
