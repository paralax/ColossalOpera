# Description

When we want to snap a picture at the zoo or a tourist attraction, we want to stand as close as we can. Sometimes there's a barrier in the way. Given a fence and the location of the thing you want to take a picture of, can you help calculate the best spot for a picture?

# Example Input

On the first line, you'll be given a pair of coordinates that describe the fence as a straight line. Then on the second line you'll be given the coordinates for the thing you want to take a picture of (e.g. an animal at the zoo). Example:

    (1,1),(1,5)
    (3,3)

# Example Output

Your program should emit the coordinates of where you should stand along the fence to be closest to the object you want to get a picture of. Example:

    (1,3)

# Challenge Input

    (1,1),(10,10)
    (7,3)

    (3,9),(10,1)
    (9,9)
