# Description

Anagrams, where you take the letters from one or more words and rearrange them to spell something else, are a fun word game. 

In this challenge you'll be asked to create anagrams from specific inputs. You should ignore capitalization as needed, and use only English language words. Note that because there are so many possibilities, there are no "right" answers so long as they're valid English language words and proper anagrams. Spaces and punctuation are not crucial, nor are capital letters. 

# Example Input

First you'll be given an integer on a single line, this tells you how many lines to read. Then you'll be given a word (or words) on *N* lines to make anagrams for. Example:

    1
    Field of dreams

# Example Output 

Your program should emit the original word and one or more anagrams it developed. Example:

    Field of dreams -> Dads Offer Lime
    Field of dreams -> Deaf Fold Miser
