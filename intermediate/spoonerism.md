# Description

A spoonerism is an error in speech or deliberate play on words in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched (see metathesis) between two words in a phrase. It is named after the Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844â€“1930), Warden of New College, Oxford, who was notoriously prone to this mistake. The term "Spoonerism" was well established by 1921. 

Example spoonerisms include:

* "A blushing crow." ("crushing blow")
* "Resident Pagan" (President Reagan)
* "belly jeans" (jelly beans)

Generating spoonerisms is kind of tricky, but follows a simple rule: swap the leading consonants of the two words. Programmatically this is easy, adjusting spelling for the pronunciation is tougher (and out of scope for this challenge). 

# Input Description

You'll be given a two word phrase, one per line, for which to generate a spoonerism. Words with which you need to swap letters will be capitalized to differentiate from stop words. Example:

    Bold Clue

# Output Description

Your program should emit the spoonerism form of the two word phrase. Spelling isn't an issue. Example:

    Bold Clue -> Cold Blue

# Challenge Input

    Swap Letters
    Lord of the Flies
    Daily Bread

# Challenge Output

    Swap Letters -> Lap Swetters (which sounds like "Lop Sweaters")
    Lord of the Flies -> Flord of the Lies (which is awfully close to "Ford of the Lies")
    Daily Bread -> Braily Dead (or "Baily Dread")
