# Difficulty

Intermediate

# Tags

# Description

Any Excel user is probably familiar with the bar chart - a simple plot showing vertical bars to represent the frequency of something you counted. For today's challenge you'll be producing bar charts in ASCII. 

(Part 2 will have you assemble a proper histogram from a collection of data.)

# Input Description

You'll be given four numbers on the first line telling you the start and end of the horizontal (X) axis and the vertical (Y) axis, respectively. Then you'll have a number on a single line telling you how many records to read. Then you'll be given the data as three numbers: the first two represent the interval as a start (inclusive) and end (exclusive), the third number is the frequency of that variable. Example:

	140 190 1 8 
	5
	140 150 1
	150 160 0 
	160 170 7 
	170 180 6 
	180 190 2 

# Output Description

Your program should emit an ASCII bar chart showing the frequencies of the buckets. Your program may use any character to represent the data point, I show an asterisk below. From the above example:

	8
	7           *
	6           *   *
	5           *   *
	4           *   *
	3           *   *
	2           *   *   *
	1   *       *   *   * 
	 140 150 160 170 180 190
