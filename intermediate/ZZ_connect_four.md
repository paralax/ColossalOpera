# Description

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs (like checkers) from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. 

A fun discourse on winning strategies at Connect Four is found [here](http://www.pomakis.com/c4/expert_play.html). 

In this challenge you'll be given a set of game moves and then be asked to figure out who won and when (there are more moves than needed). 

For sake of consistency, this is how we'll organize the board, rows as numbers *1-6* descending and columns as letters *a-g*.  This was chosen to make the first moves in row 1.

	    a b c d e f g
	6   . . . . . . . 
	5   . . . . . . . 
	4   . . . . . . . 
	3   . . . . . . . 
	2   . . . . . . . 
	1   . . . . . . . 

# Input Description

You'll be given a game with a list of moves. Moves will be given by *column only* (gotta make this challenging somehow). We'll call the players *X* and *O*, with *X* going first using columns designated with an uppercase letter and *O* going second and moves designated with the lowercase letter of the column they chose.
