# Description

When he was 19 years old, Carl Friedrich Gauss proved that every integer is sum of three triangular numbers. This is often called his _eureka_ theorem, as his diary on 10 July 1796 contains the line "EUREKA n = triangle triangle triangle" (it looks much better in his original handwriting). 

Triangular numbers are those denumerating a collection of objects which can be arranged in the form of an equilateral triangle. They start 1, 3, 6, 10, and so forth. 

Your challenge today is to calculate the eureka formula for a given integer. 

# Input Description

You'll be given an integer, one per line, a input. Example:

    4
    44

# Output Description

Your program should emit which three triangular numbers sum to the given input. You may use a given triangular number more than once. Example:

    4 = 3 + 1 + 0
    44 = 28 + 10 + 6

# Challenge Inputs

    39
    468
    12961
    971261

# Challenge Output

    39 = 28 + 10 + 1
    468 = 
    12961 = 
    971261 =
