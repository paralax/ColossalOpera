# Description

[The Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is a famous integer series in the field of mathematics. The sequence is recursively defined for n > 1 by the formula *f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)*. In plain english, each term in the sequence is found by adding the previous two terms together.  Given the starting values of *f(0) = 0* and *f(1) = 1* the first ten terms of the sequence are:

> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

We will notice however that some numbers are left out of the sequence and don't get any of the fame, 9 is an example. However, if we were to start the sequence with a different value for *f(1)* we will generate a new sequence of numbers. Here is the series for *f(1) = 3*:

> 0 3 3 6 **9** 15 24 39 102 165

We now have a sequence that contains the number 9. What joy!  
Today you will write a program that will find the lowest positive integer for *f(1)* that will generate a Fibonacci-ish sequence containing the desired integer (let's call it *x*).

# Input description  
Your input will be a single positive integer *x*.

Sample Input 1: 21  

Sample Input 2: 84  


# Output description  
The sequence of integers generated using the recursion relation starting from 0 and ending at the desired integer *x* with the lowest value of *f(1)*.

Sample Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

Sample Output: 0 4 4 8 12 20 32 52 84

# Challenge Inputs

Input 1: 0  
Input 2: 578  
Input 3: 123456789  

# Notes/Hints
Large inputs (such as input 3) may take some time given your implementation. However, there is a relationship between sequences generated using *f(1) > 1* and the classic sequence that can be exploited.

# Bonus
Make your program run as fast as possible.
