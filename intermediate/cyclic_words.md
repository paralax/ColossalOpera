# Description

A cyclic word is a word that can be cleaved somewhere in the middle of it, the two halves swapped and then rejoined to form another legitimate word. For example the word `slaughter` is one with `laughters` - cleave after the `s` and move `laughter` from the end to the beginning.

For this challenge you can use the famous `enable1.txt` file or `/usr/share/dict/words`, as long as it's an English dictionary.
