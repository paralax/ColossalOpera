# Description

Defining a palindrome as a string that reads the same backwards and forwards, can you write a program that identifies the longest palindrome in the input string and then counts how many palindromes exist with that length?

Can you do so efficiently? Perhaps O(n)? 

# Input Description

    ababab

# Output Description

    ababab -> 4

This is because the longest palindrome is length 3:

    aba
     bab
      aba
       bab

# Challenge Input
