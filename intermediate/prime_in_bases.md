# Description

Take a number that's prime in base 10 and convert it to its representation in other bases. Now let’s forget that all these base numbers are in a bases b other than 10 and let’s ask how many of them keep being primes base 10.

For example: 379081 is a prime in base 10, 637001 in base 9 (and is prime in base 10), 1344311 in base 8 (and is prime in base 10), etc. 

# Input Description

You'll be given a series of integers, one set per line. Example:

    10 9 8

# Output Description

Your program should emit an integer that is prime in base 10 when converted to representations in those bases. Example:

    379081 637001 1344311

# Challenge Input

    10 9 8 7 6 5 3 2
    10 9 8 7 5 4 3 2
    10 9 8 7 6 5 3 2
    10 9 8 7 6 5 4 2

# Challenge Output

    59771671 
    146752831
    764479423
    1479830551
