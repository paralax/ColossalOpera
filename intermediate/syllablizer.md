# Description

A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds. For example, the word water is composed of two syllables: wa and ter. A syllable is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants).

For this challenge your program should take English language words and count the number of syllables in them.

If you have ever wished to automatically create poetry like a haiku, this is one of the components you'll need.
