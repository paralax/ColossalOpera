# Description

A brick wall is a rectangle made of horizontal 1-by-n bricks stacked into rows. A wall is sturdy if no two vertical edges of bricks appear in the same line. Here's an example of a sturdy wall:

	[___][___]
	_][___][__
	[___][___]

And here's an example of a wall with a fault (it is not sturdy):

	[______][______]   
	[__][____][__][]   
	[][______][____]   
	[____][______][]   

In this challenge your task is to create walls at least three bricks high that are sturdy.

# Input Description

	1: [_]
	2: [__]
	3: [___]
	4: [____]
	...

# Output Description

Your program should emit a sturdy brick wall as ASCII art. If you have more than one possible solution, draw one or more.
