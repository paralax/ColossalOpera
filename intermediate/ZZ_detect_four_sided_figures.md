# Description

I got this idea from the [Mensa quiz](https://www.mensa.org/workout/questions), specifically question 17. It's a basic scanning challenge: can your program detect and count intersecting bounding boxes from an ASCII art input? A four-sided figure is an ASCII art rectangle. Note that it can overlap another one, as long as the four corners are fully connected. 

# Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs

Your program will be given an ASCII art chart showing boxes and lines. `-` and `|` characters indicate horizontal and vertical lines, respectively, while "+" characters show intersections.

Your program should emit an integer, *N*, of how many unique four sided figures it found. Rectangles and squares both count.

# Example Output

For the above diagram your program should find 25 four sided figures. 

# Challenge Input

This one adds a bit to the complexity by throwing in some three sided figures. This should catch more naive implementations.
